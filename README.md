Java Tetris game I made in high school

This is an old Tetris game I made back in high school. There's a lot of things I would have done differently now that I didn't know about back then; for instance, it makes use of public variables instead of getters and setters, and has every piece hard-coded into the memory in every possible orientation in a big ugly switch block.
